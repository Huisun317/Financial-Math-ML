# Financial-Math-ML


This repository contains a miscellany of ideas/presentations that are related to Stochastic Computing, data science and AI. All of the code are written in python Jupyter notebook. Instead of showing only the code, most of the ideas are illustrated with mathematical insights and sometimes even with proofs.
