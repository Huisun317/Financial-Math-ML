# Financial-Math-ML


This repository contains a miscellany of ideas/presentations that are related to Stochastic Computing, data science and AI. All of the code are written in python Jupyter notebook. Instead of showing only the code, most of the ideas are illustrated with mathematical insights and sometimes even with proofs. 

Currently, the repository contains the following contents with more to be added in the near future:
* **Price the American Option with Random Forest**
In this work, we apply the Longstaff Schwartz algorithm and apply a few regression methods (Random Forest, polynomial regression etc) to solve one simple problem.

* **Understanding the Gaussian Process** 
In this writing, we explain the kernel method for Bayesian learning. 

* **RealNVP with a simple application to Bingham distribution**
In this work, we give a detailed mathematical derivation and explanation for the RealNVP algorithm. Code domo is given for generating the 2-D Bingham distribution. 

* **WGANï¼štheory and example**
In this work, we explain the Wasserstein GAN, prove the duality theorem, describe the connection between finite dimensional linear programming and the infinite dimension case. Finally, code demonstration is given on generating the MNIST handwritten digits.

* **LSTM sequential learning**
In this work, we describe the working mechanism of both GRU and LSTM. And we give an example of predicting the price of Bitcoin by using LSTM.
